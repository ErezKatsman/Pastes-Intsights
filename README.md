# Deep-Web-Scraper

In this project, i built Deep web [scraper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) web application. 
This app scrapes all the pastes from onion paste site. This site contains a lot of criminal activity, ranging from illegal hacking and data theft attempts, through hitmans and other criminal services for sell and all the way to links to child pornography sites. This site resides on the darknet, and is only accessible through the [TOR network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)) that provides the cyber criminals with anonymity. After setting up your TOR access, youâ€™ll be able to access the site on: http://nzxj65x32vh2fkhk.onion/all.
